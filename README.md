Plaintext to BF converter
=========================

Another txt2bf converter written in python.
Output is shorter than from the other txt2bf here on git, although code is much larger.

Usage
=====

txt2bf.py input output
txt2bf.py input          // output goes to stdout
txt2bf.py input --no-nl  // without newlines - everything is in single line
